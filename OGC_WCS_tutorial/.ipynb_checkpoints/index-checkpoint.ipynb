      "This tutorial gives an introduction to the standard data-access protocols [Web Coverage Service](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) (WCS) 2.0 and its extension [Web Coverage Processing Service](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps) (WCPS) 1.0.   Both standards are defined by the [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org) (OGC).  \n",

      "In the framework of the H2020-funded [EarthServer-2](http://earthserver.eu) project, the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is setting up a WCS server in order to study the feasibility and to demonstrate the potential of efficient web-based data access via WCS and WCPS interfaces. You can find more information about ECMWF's role within EarthServer [here](http://ecmwf.int/en/research/projects/earthserver-2).\n",

      "* the purpose and importance of the WCS and WCPS standards,\n",
      "* how data can be accessed, processed and retrieved with the help of a WC(P)S, and\n",
