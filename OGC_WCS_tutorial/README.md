# Geospatial data access via standard web services | Tutorial
This tutorial is a series of IPython Notebooks that provides (i) a general introduction to web standards for geospatial data and (ii) practical hands-on exercises how to access, retrieve and process data served with a WCS server. 

After working through the tutorial, you should have a clearer idea of: 
* OGC standards for geospatial data in general,
* the purpose and importance of the WCS and WCPS standards, 
* how data can be accessed, processed and retrieved with the help of a WC(P)S, and 
* how WC(P)S requests can easily be integrated into processing routines or used to build custom web-applications.

For any questions related to the WCS service, please contact us via earthserver@lists.ecmwf.int
